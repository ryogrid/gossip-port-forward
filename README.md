- **Now, relay node is running at ryogrid.net:9999 and its address is hard coded as bootstrap node for demonstration**
- **So, you don't need to launch relay node by myself, though data transfer is done without encryption**
- If you want use self relay node, you should replace hard coded relay node address and run the relay node at your machine which is accessible from the Internet
